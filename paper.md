# Teaching Data Visualization to 10-Year-Old Children with Popcorn Color Activities  
===  

## Introduction  
- First, support the system education.  
- Data visualization for an environment with new requirements.  
- The goal of the workshop.  

---  

### 1. Stimulate Data Visualization  
Data visualization translates complex datasets into visual formats that are easier for the human brain to understand.  
Developing curiosity about math helps kids find interesting trends.  
It simplifies complex concepts and includes playful elements.  

### 2. Design  
The content meets educational guidelines and addresses specific learning objectives.  

### 3. Workshop Flow  

#### **Day 1**  
Build a paper spreadsheet together to introduce non-technical newcomers to concepts like “data,” “datasets,” and “data types.”  

**Types of Data Cards Activity**  
1. **Qualitative Data**  
   - Definition: Non-numerical data that describes qualities, characteristics, or experiences.  

2. **Geographic Data (Geospatial Data)**  
   - Definition: Data tied to specific locations (coordinates, addresses, regions).  

3. **Categorical Data**  
   - Definition: Data divided into categories or groups (nominal or ordinal).  

4. **Quantitative Data**  
   - Definition: Numerical data that can be measured or counted.  

5. **Temporal Data (Time-Series Data)**  
   - Definition: Data collected over time (dates, timestamps).  

6. **Open Text as Data (Textual Data)**  
   - Definition: Unstructured text from sources like social media, reviews, or documents.  

#### **Day 2**  
**Chart Champions:**  
A competitive card game where players collect and compare data (shown as bar/pie charts) and modify them to win points.  

- **Data Cards:** Each card shows a topic (e.g., "Favorite Ice Cream Flavors") with either a bar chart or pie chart.  
- **Action Cards:** Special cards that add twists (e.g., "Double the highest bar!" or "Rotate the pie chart!").  
- **Question Cards:** Challenge players to interpret charts (e.g., "Which flavor is least popular?").  

**Battle Round:**  
- Players flip a Data Card from their hand onto the table.  
- A Question Card is drawn (e.g., "Which category has the smallest value?").  
- The first player to answer correctly (pointing to their card’s chart) wins the round and collects the cards.  

**Action Round:**  
- If an Action Card is played (e.g., "Swap one bar with another!"), players adjust their charts before answering.  

**Example of Play:**  
- **Data Card (Bar Chart):**  
  Topic: "Pets Owned by Kids"  
  - Dogs: 50%  
  - Cats: 30%  
  - Fish: 20%  
- **Question Card:**  
  "Which pet is twice as popular as fish?"  

#### **Day 3**  
1. **Create our popcorn dataset**  
   - Give popcorn of each color.  
2. **Create a question**  
   - Which colors are most and least common?  
3. **Work in groups to figure out how they can create that**  
   - Separating colors.  
4. **Ask them more questions**  
   - Encourage them to share their answers.

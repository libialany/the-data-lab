- ‘First name’ for qualitative data
- ‘Hometown’ for geographic data
- ‘Color of Your Shirt’ for categorical data
- ‘# Siblings you Have’ for quantitative data
- ‘Day & Month of your Birthday’ for temporal data
- ‘Describe any experience you have with data’ for open text as data.

### 1. **Qualitative Data**  
   - **Definition**: Non-numerical data that describes qualities, characteristics, or experiences.  
   - **Uses**:  
     - Used in social sciences, market research, and psychology to understand human behavior, opinions, and motivations.  
     - Helps in exploratory research (e.g., interviews, focus groups, case studies).  
     - Provides context to quantitative findings.  

### 2. **Geographic Data (Geospatial Data)**  
   - **Definition**: Data tied to specific locations (coordinates, addresses, regions).  
   - **Uses**:  
     - Used in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for mapping and spatial analysis.  
     - Applied in urban planning, logistics, environmental studies, and disaster management.  
     - Helps businesses optimize location-based services (e.g., delivery routes, store placements).  

### 3. **Categorical Data**  
   - **Definition**: Data divided into categories or groups (nominal or ordinal).  
   - **Uses**:  
     - Used in surveys (e.g., gender, education level, product preferences).  
     - Helps in classification tasks in machine learning (e.g., spam detection, customer segmentation).  
     - Supports statistical analysis (e.g., chi-square tests).  

### 4. **Quantitative Data**  
   - **Definition**: Numerical data that can be measured or counted.  
   - **Uses**:  
     - Used in statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.  
     - Applied in finance (stock prices), healthcare (patient vitals), and engineering (performance metrics).  
     - Enables mathematical computations (averages, correlations, regressions).  

### 5. **Temporal Data (Time-Series Data)**  
   - **Definition**: Data collected over time (dates, timestamps).  
   - **Uses**:  
     - Used in forecasting (stock market trends, weather predictions).  
     - Helps track changes (sales trends, website traffic).  
     - Applied in IoT (sensor data monitoring).  

### 6. **Open Text as Data (Textual Data)**  
   - **Definition**: Unstructured text from sources like social media, reviews, or documents.  
   - **Uses**:
     - Used in NLP (Natural Language Processing) for sentiment analysis, chatbots, and topic modeling.  
     - Helps in customer feedback analysis (e.g., product reviews).  
     - Supports qualitative research (thematic analysis).  

### You can get at this by asking your group a couple questions related to the Paper Spreadsheet:

    Do the colors people wrote down accurately capture all the texture and nuance of their fabric? For example, if anyone wore a striped shirt, what did they write in the 'shirt color' column?
    Do these questions capture enough of who each person is to analyze?
    What is missing that might help use this dataset?

# Data learning activities

## activity one (create stories)

Participants spend time poking at an actual dataset to find a simple story, then sketch their story and play with different ways of telling it in a fun, visual storybook form.

### requirements

1. Paper
2. Crayons
3. Take examples from tableu data.
4. https://databasic.io/static/files/examples/storybook1.pdf

### Examples

**Title:** *Which Cat Breed is Most Popular?*  

Once upon a time, in a cozy little town, there was a cat lover named Mia. She wanted to know which cat breeds were the most popular among her friends. She asked 100 people about their favorite breeds and made a pie chart!  

**Pie Chart:**  
- **Persian (30%)** – Fluffy and calm  
- **Siamese (25%)** – Talkative and sleek  
- **Maine Coon (20%)** – Big and friendly  
- **Bengal (15%)** – Wild-looking and playful  
- **Sphynx (10%)** – Hairless and warm  

*Fun Fact:* Persian cats are the oldest known breed!  

**Title:** *How Old Are Our Furry Friends?*  

Mia also wanted to learn about the ages and genders of cats in her neighborhood. She collected data from 50 cats and made a bar chart!  

**Bar Chart (X-axis: Age Groups | Y-axis: Number of Cats)**  
- **Kittens (0-1 year):** 15 (♀: 8 | ♂: 7)  
- **Young Adults (2-4 years):** 20 (♀: 9 | ♂: 11)  
- **Adults (5-10 years):** 10 (♀: 6 | ♂: 4)  
- **Seniors (11+ years):** 5 (♀: 3 | ♂: 2)  

*Did You Know?* Female cats (♀) tend to live longer than males (♂)!  



After this activity, the budding data explorer should be able to:

    Describe the data collection process
    Interpret bar charts in order to describe the variance of color across populations (bags of candy)
    Make informed predictions about the commonality of each color.
